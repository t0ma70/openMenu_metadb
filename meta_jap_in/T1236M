description=Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service is a fighting game developed by Capcom, and one of many updates to the popular fighting game, Street Fighter II. This version was released for the Sega Dreamcast exclusively in Japan in 2000. It is an enhanced port of Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge, known as Super Street Fighter II Turbo in the west. The game is virtually identical to other ports of Super Street Fighter II X/Super Street Fighter II Turbo, but is compatible with Capcom's "matching service", meaning players can compete online.
